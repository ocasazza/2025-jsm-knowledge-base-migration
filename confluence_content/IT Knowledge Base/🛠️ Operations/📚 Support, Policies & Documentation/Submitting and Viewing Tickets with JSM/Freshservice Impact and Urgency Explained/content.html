<p>
 When submitting a ticket for an issue it is important to classify the urgency and impact correctly so it receives the correct level of attention from the team you are escalating to.
</p>
<p>
 When these have been entered accurately they will show up in the cue with the correct priority and enable the team to address the most business critical issues first.
</p>
<p>
 Urgency indicating the time sensitivity of the issue and Impact indicating the scale of the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 Another important thing to remember is CONTEXT when filling out the issue description.
</p>
<p>
 Without proper context we will not be able to accurately evaluate whether the priority is correct or needs to be adjusted.
</p>
<h4>
 Example
</h4>
<p>
 You are submitting a ticket for your external webcam not working.
</p>
<p>
 Now with no further context to that issue I would probably put that as
</p>
<p>
 Low Impact, Medium Urgency.
</p>
<p>
 Low Impact because it is only affecting you
</p>
<p>
 Medium Urgency because of how much we use video conferencing and that interfaces with other people
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 Now adding in the context of,
</p>
<p>
 My laptop webcam doesn’t work. I have no alternative means of attending meetings AND I have a meeting with the board in 1/2 an hour.
</p>
<p>
 The priority, obviously would be changed to High Urgency and High Impact
</p>
<p>
 High Urgency due to the time constraints
</p>
<p>
 High Impact due to the business critical nature of the meeting
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Now for a less drastic example.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Let’s say you are submitting a ticket because you would prefer a different USB-C hub than the one you were issued.
</p>
<p>
 This would obviously be a Low Impact, Low Urgency issue.
</p>
<p>
 Low Impact because it is only affecting you
</p>
<p>
 Low urgency because it does not affect your ability to work
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 Now with the additional context of,
</p>
<p>
 You've ask around and 1/3 of the company doesn’t like the USB-C hubs they were issued.
</p>
<p>
 This is a perfect example of a High Impact, Low Urgency Issue that we should look into.
</p>
<p>
 High Impact because it is affecting a Large number of people
</p>
<p>
 Low urgency because it is not affecting their ability to work
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 For further transparency, below is our priority matrix.

 This lays out what priorities the different impact/urgency combinations equal to.
