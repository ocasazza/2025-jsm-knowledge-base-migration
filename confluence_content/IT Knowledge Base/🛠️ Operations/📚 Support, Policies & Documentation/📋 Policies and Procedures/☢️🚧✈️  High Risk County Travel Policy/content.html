   Guidelines for traveling abroad to certain locations.
  </p>
 </ac:rich-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>
 Travel to countries classified as "High Risk" requires that we take additional precautions to ensure not only connectivity, but also limit the potential effects of surveillance and prevent a data breach. These guidelines are intended to not only reduce the risk while traveling, but also contain any potential contamination or systems breach upon return. This policy applies to travel for
 <strong>
  business purposes only.

<h3>
 Countries classified as "High Risk"
</h3>
<p>
 Countries identified here are locations in which Schrödinger may have significant financial interest, but also have highly developed electronic surveillance capabilities. The countries listed also may have a somewhat adversarial relationship with the United States, increasing the likelihood that electronic surveillance would be attempted.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>
   China
  </p>
 </li>
