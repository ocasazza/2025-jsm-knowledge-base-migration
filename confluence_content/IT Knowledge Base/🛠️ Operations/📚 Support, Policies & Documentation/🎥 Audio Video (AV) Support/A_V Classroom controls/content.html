 Quick Tips for Classroom(s) Downtown/Uptown A &amp; B
</h1>
<p>
 <strong>
  The rooms can be combined or used separately.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 In the Creston Panel settings, navigate to the divisibility state and select either "Divided" or "Combined."
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Divided
   </strong>
   : This option disconnects the rooms, ensuring that all sound and audio comes from one side of the room.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Combined
   </strong>
   : This option merges the rooms, allowing them to share audio and video.
  </p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 You will see which room is activated on the screen. If the screens display "UPTOWN" and "DOWNTOWN," it indicates that the rooms are not combined. Conversely, if they are combined, only "UPTOWN" or "DOWNTOWN" will appear in the corner of the screen.
</p>
<h2>
 FloorBox
</h2>
<p>
 <strong>
  There are three FloorBoxes in the room.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 These allow computers to be plugged in and viewed on the screens using HDMI or other inputs. The active FloorBox will be highlighted on the Creston Panel on the wall when a computer is connected.
</p>
<h2>
 Zoom Controls
</h2>
<p>
 If you prefer not to share your screen via a wired connection, you can easily screen share through Zoom. Here’s how:
</p>
<ol start="1">
 <li>
  <p>
   Start a meeting on the Zoom tablet located on either side of the room.
  </p>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 <strong>
  Note
 </strong>
 : If you use the Downtown iPad to initiate a meeting, it will display on that side of the room, and the same applies to the Uptown part. To utilize all screens, ensure that the "COMBINED" button is pressed on the Creston Panel above the iPads.
</p>
<h2>
 Microphone Control
</h2>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Ceiling Microphones
   </strong>
   : These can be turned off if handheld microphones are in use to prevent feedback noise.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Voice Reinforcement
   </strong>
   : Primarily used in the combined room setup, this feature amplifies voices for those in the room.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Voice Lift
   </strong>
   : This function enhances the speaker's voice, focusing on their audio.
  </p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 When the rooms are combined, you can use the microphones and lapel mics from either side to communicate. Each microphone has an ON switch and will activate immediately. The lapel mics also feature an ON switch, and their volume can be adjusted to suit the presenter’s preference.
