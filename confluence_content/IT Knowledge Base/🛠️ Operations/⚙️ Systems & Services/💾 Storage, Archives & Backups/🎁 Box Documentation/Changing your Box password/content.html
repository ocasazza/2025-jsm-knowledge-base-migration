<p>
 We use Okta/SSO to sign into Box. However, due to our current (as of

 ) Box enterprise settings (see

 for more details), when signing into Box via Okta, you may periodically be prompted by Box to change your Box password.
</p>
<p>
 When you are asked to do this, proceed with the Box instructions. When asked to enter a new password, you can enter your current Okta password, or if if that is not accepted, use a random password.   The new password you enter for Box won't actually be used later, because of Okta/SSO, but you still need to change it when Box asks you to do so, to be able to login again.
