 Organization &amp; Templates

<p>
 Each page should be well scoped to one item or topic. This is a deliberate choice that will ensure our IT Service Desk portal will suggest individual pages that do not contain pieces of information outside the scope of their request.
</p>
<p>
 Each page should contain the following items:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>
   Tags that match the contents of the page. Ensure any “kb-*” tags are correctly assigned (

   Excerpt macro at the beginning of the page that contains a summary. You can use the AI summary feature to quickly generate this.

   If we’re asking people to read a document, we want to make the transfer of information as quick and simple as possible, while still communicating the correct information.

 Formatting
</h2>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>

   Please use
