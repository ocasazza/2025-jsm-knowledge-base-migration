      new firmware image
     </a>
     to the controller over the web UI. Note that the page linked contains a firmware image that was posted on 5/21, the day after we attempted the upgrade.  I have not uploaded the firmware image we used here because it is over 1.5GB. The firmware upload process takes quite a long time (20+ minutes), but you can maintain your web session on the controller just fine as it is displaying real-time progress for the upload.
     <ul>
      <li>
       After the firmware image is uploaded, the Controller runs "validation scripts" that are part of the firmware package to confirm that the environment is able to be safely upgraded.  Under the hood this appears to be version and dependency checking for all components (including WAPs) as well as database checks/preparations on the controller itself.
      </li>
     </ul>

   <p>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <ul class="alternate">
    <li>
     7:30PM - The firmware upload completed and the controller began running validation scripts to prepare for the upgrade.
    </li>
    <li>
     7:40PM - The controller stopped the upgrade process because it found that there were devices still on the 5.1. firmware.
     <ul>
      <li>
       This was fine, Austin and I then upgraded the firmware on the two "behind" Tokyo APs to bring them to 5.2 so that they could then be upgraded to 6.0. This upgrade succeeded and the APs were rebooted cleanly and we confirmed that they were connected to the controller and showing the correct version.

   <p>

   <ul class="alternate">
    <li>
     7:45PM - CJ starts the upgrade process again, which requires re-uploading the firmware image to the Controller.
    </li>
    <li>
     8:15PM - The upload process completes and the controller runs validation scripts again.  This time, the controller immediately displays the same error stating that there are devices still on 5.1 firmware that need to be upgraded before the 6.0 upgrade can proceed. This was mysterious to us, so we checked again and confirmed that all APs were on version 5.2.  We also made sure that there were no disconnected APs in the controller that were on the old version (no ghost APs).

   </ul>
   <p>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <ul class="alternate">
    <li>
     8:20PM - We decide to reboot the Controller to get it in a clean state before we try the upgrade again. The controller took quite awhile to reboot and become reachable (~20 minutes IIRC).
    </li>
    <li>
     8:40PM - Once the controller is back, we try the upgrade again (upload firmware, let it run validation scripts, etc.)

   </p>
   <ul class="alternate">
    <li>
     8:45PM - This time, when uploading the firmware, the controller's web UI kicked my session within a few minutes of the upload starting. We found this super odd because each upload process we had done before kept the web session running and displayed upload progress in real-time.
    </li>
    <li>
     9:00PM - We relocated to an area with better wireless coverage in the office and made sure our internet connection was stable, and we then tried to upload the firmware again (our theory had been that our internet connection dropped and that's why the upload failed).
    </li>
    <li>
     9:05PM - We get kicked from the web UI of the controller within a few minutes again, even when we confirmed we had a stable connection to the controller.

     9:10PM - We ssh to the Controller VM to start investigating the health of the system. All of the system's services are down, and they won't start.  We were seeing ~50 java stack dumps per second in the console logs of the controller.

     10:30PM - 11:30PM - We take a break to eat cause we're both starving and we needed some time to think about what to do next.
    </li>
    <li>
     11:30PM - 1:45AM - We continue to look through logs on the Controller, scour the Ruckus forums (and other sites) for any resources or info on the issues we're seeing (java stack dumps, errors from service start failures, etc.)
    </li>
    <li>
     2:00AM - We decide to go to bed, and that we will build a new Controller VM in GCP in the morning and use the config backup to get all the controllers added to it once it's up and on the network.

    5/21
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     10:00AM - After All-Hands meeting, CJ begins looking into wired and wireless networking issues in the NYC office (both 20 and 21st floors).
    </li>
    <li>
     12:00 PM - Austin begins building the new Controller VM in GCP.
    </li>
    <li>
     ~2:00PM - New Controller VM is built and accessible on the network, and we begin to try and get WAPs added to it after loading the backup config.
     <ul>
      <li>
       We aren't able to get the APs into the new controller's inventory because the new VM did not have a matching license
      </li>
      <li>
       Austin opens a Ruckus Support ticket (RMA) requesting a license transfer from the old Controller VM to the new Controller VM
      </li>
      <li>
       While we wait on support, Austin discovers all the new documentation on Ruckus' website and we began reviewing the newly available material and download the new firmware image and sigpacks for the APs.
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     ~4:00PM - We get the new license file from Ruckus Support and transfer it to the new VM.
    </li>
    <li>
     ~4:30PM - Only 3 controllers successfully added themselves to the new controller. One in Tokyo, one in Portland, and one in Munich.
    </li>
    <li>
     ~5:00PM - 10:00PM - We research how to try and get the APs to connect to the new controller (Ruckus forums, as well as the new release notes for 6.0.0 which contained very large write-ups on upgrade failures/problems/considerations that were not in the release notes that were available the day before).
     <ul>
      <li>
       Durring this time CJ is also trying to fix up the NYC office network that was still exhibiting issues, especially the floor 20 stack which will not establish POE links to any of the WAPs.
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     10:00PM - 11:30PM - We finally figure out how to get the APs added to the controller inventory. It requires a two-pronged approach (with mixed results in both cases):
     <ul>
      <li>
       Encoding the Internal IP Address of the new Controller in DHCP Option 43
      </li>
      <li>
       SSHing to the APs and wiping their Smartzone association and pointing them to the new Controller's Public and Private IP addresses.
       <ul>
        <li>
         It seems that the controllers always connect to the Public IP first, then switchover tot he Private IP, regardless of the DHCP option being present and received (at least this was the behavior we observed).
        </li>
        <li>
         SSHing to them proved tricky because only some of them accepted the credentials that we expected them to use.
         <ul>
          <li>
           Some of them worked with the Smartzone admin password.
          </li>
          <li>
           Some of them only worked with the Smartzone

           <em>
            enable
           </em>
           <span>

           password.
          </li>
         </ul>
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       Once the APs get the new config, they connect to the controller, attempt to upgrade themselves to 6.0, then fail the upgrade and reboot themselves.
       <ul>
        <li>
         Then they connect again and successfully upgrade themselves and reboot one more time before they are fully functional.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     11:30PM - We started driving back to Seattle.  CJ spent the drive SSHing to all of the APs and performing the necessary steps to get them added to the new controller.
    </li>
    <li>
     2:30AM - We arrive in Seattle and CJ finishes getting all of the APs that would accept the known credentials connected to the controller.
     <ul>
      <li>
       The APs that would not accept known creds were in Manheim, NYC and PDX.
      </li>
      <li>
       Additionally, none of the NYC 20th floor APs were able to draw POE power from the misbehaving stack.
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <p>
    5/24
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Austin was able to get the Manheim and PDX APs re-added to the controller in the morning.
    </li>
    <li>
     Austin rebooted blade 7 of the NYC floor 20 stack in the afternoon to troubleshoot the POE issues, which inadvertently brought the entire stack into a non-functioning state.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <p>
    5/25
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     CJ works with Nate early in the morning to power down and cleanly power up the NYC floor 20 stack
    </li>
    <li>
     After this, the POE issues went away and we were able to get those APs added to the new controller (the last ones).

    We communicated with the rest of the team in the SYSMGR channel and provided regular updates.  The team managed communication with end users in the IT Support Hotline channel while Austin and I were working on the issue.  Thankfully, the affected user base was not too large since the outage was on a Friday and only affected in-office users.

    If not, how can this be improved?

   <p>
    - We could work with the rest of Schrodinger to establish regular CAB meetings to communicate, schedule, and review all changes and maintenance that can potentially be user impacting.  This proactive approach would help insure that our users are aware of maintenance/changes so that they can plan accordingly.

    Mitigation
   </h2>
   <hr/>
   <h3>
    What went well that helped minimize the impact of this problem?
   </h3>
   <ul>
    <li>
     The config backup of the SmartZone worked*
    </li>
    <li>
     Ruckus Support didn't keep us on hold for too long and were able to facilitate the license transfer quickly*
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h3>
    What can be done to minimize the impact if a problem like this recurs?
   </h3>
   <ul>
    <li>
     We should try and uniformly deploy the DHCP Option 43 configuration on our DHCP servers so that new controllers automatically learn the SmartZone IPs and can join more seamlessly.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
    Avoidance
   </h2>
   <hr/>
   <h3>
    What can we do in the future to avoid a problem like this?
   </h3>
   <ul>
    <li>
     A more rigorous backup &amp; restore solution can be created.  Even if the only additional process is that we briefly shut down the VM and snapshot it after config changes, which should be quite infrequent since we are not adding/removing new devices to SmartZone on a regular basis.  Additionally, we should shut down the VM and take a snapshot before performing an upgrade.  It would probably be a good idea to test the restore of this snapshot backup before performing the upgrade as well. **
    </li>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li>
     We should set up an additional SmartZone instance for HA configuration.  This will help us with resiliency during both nominal and upgrade scenarios. Ideally we would set one up in a European GCP region to provide regional redundancy and better WAP &lt;–&gt; Controller communication performance for our European sites.
    </li>
   </ul>
