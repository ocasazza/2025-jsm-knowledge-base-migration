 Did you recently update to macOS Ventura and are having troubles logging into older hosts?
</p>
<p>
 Example Error: "Unable to negotiate with 172.19.17.46 port 22: no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-rsa"
</p>
<h1>
 Root cause:
</h1>
<p>
 The underlying issue is that Ventura ships with
 <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.7">
  OpenSSH_9 which disables using the RSA/SHA1 algorithm for
  <strong>
   host keys
  </strong>
 </a>
 . The destination server being ssh-ed into, doesn’t support (or doesn't have enabled) the newer RSA/SHA256 host keys. Eventually, one assumes the ssh server software will get upgraded and use RSA/SHA256 host keys, but not every destination can be updated quickly, or sometimes at all.
</p>
<h1>
 Solution:
</h1>
<p>
 Add the following to the top of your ~/.ssh/config
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <sup>
   Host *
  </sup>
  <br/>
  <sup>
   HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
  </sup>
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 If there is an existing "Host *" stanza, just add the "HostKeyAlgorithims" line to the end.  The "+" is critical, it means add this algorithm to the default list.  If you omit the "+" it means
 <strong>
  only
 </strong>
 use ssh-rsa, and that would create other problems.
</p>
<p>
 You can, of course, create a Host stanza for specific destinations.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 This will allow use of the older RSA/SHA1 host keys for all remote servers.  Try logging in again.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 There are other cryptographic protocols involved in a SSH connection, if there is a mismatch they will all throw similar errors.  For example, older network devices may need to have "KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group14-sha1" added.
