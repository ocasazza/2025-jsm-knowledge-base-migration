   Jamf Connect works with Jamf to build a bridge between your MacBook account and your Okta account. In using Jamf Connect, you will be able to remember one less password, as now your MacBook password becomes the same as your Okta password.

 You would have either been enrolled in Jamf Connect through
 <a href="https://schrodinger.atlassian.net/wiki/x/XkBLAw">
  receiving a new MacBook
 </a>
 , or
 <a href="https://schrodinger.atlassian.net/wiki/x/AC5LAw">
  enrolling via the Jamf Connect policy
 </a>
 in the Self Service application.
</p>
<p>
 After enrolling in Jamf Connect, your login screen stays the same UNLESS you restart your computer. After a restart, the Jamf Connect login screen appears (shown below). Log in with your Okta username and password here and you'll gain access to your desktop.Â If you don't have access to the internet (say you're in an airport) you can still log in because your local credentials are cached.
