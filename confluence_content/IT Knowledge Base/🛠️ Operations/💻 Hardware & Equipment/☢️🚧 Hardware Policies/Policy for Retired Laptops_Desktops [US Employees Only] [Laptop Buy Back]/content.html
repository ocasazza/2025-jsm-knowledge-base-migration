 At your request, the IT department will replace your current laptop after four years of use and your desktop after five years. As an exciting new benefit, IT is pleased to offer you the option to keep your old computer as your personal device once you are upgraded. This means you can take it home and use it as you wish, including the option to give it to someone else.

   For security and license compliance reasons, we will need to wipe your hard drive before handing it over. Consequently, you will receive a computer that only has the operating system installed. If the system did not come with a transferable OS license, you will receive a blank disk.

  <h3>
   Important
  </h3>
  <p>
   In accordance with IRS regulations, Schrödinger must determine the fair market value of the equipment and report it as additional income on your next paycheck and your year-end W-2 form.
  </p>
  <p>
   For instance, if your salary for the upcoming pay period is $1000 and the fair market value of the equipment is $300, your taxable wages will temporarily increase to $1300 for that paycheck. Taxes and other deductions will be withheld based on this higher income. Consequently, you will effectively pay taxes on the $300 of equipment as if it were an additional $300 in salary. As a result, your net pay for that paycheck will be less than usual. IT will inform you of the fair market value at the time of your upgrade, allowing you to make an informed decision about whether to keep your old laptop or desktop.
  </p>
  <p>
   Please note that Schrödinger cannot provide specific advice regarding tax implications. For any tax-related inquiries, we recommend consulting a tax professional.

 If you decide not to keep the equipment, that's perfectly fine. We will add it to a pool of laptops and desktops that will be made available for general use.
