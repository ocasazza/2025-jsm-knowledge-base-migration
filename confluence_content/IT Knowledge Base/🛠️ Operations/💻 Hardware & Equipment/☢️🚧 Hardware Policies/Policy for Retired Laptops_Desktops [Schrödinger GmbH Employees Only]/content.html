<h2>
 "Buy-back" process
</h2>
<ol start="1">
 <li>
  <p>
   Initiate the "buy-back" process:
   <br/>
  </p>
  <ol start="1">
   <li>
    <p>
     as part of the employee's laptop or desktop replacement process, the employee has to confirm his or her decision of initiating the "buy-back" process with updating the corresponding "IT Help" ticket within 14 days, otherwise the laptop is put in the laptop pool automatically.
     <br/>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     an employee can initiate the "buy-back" process if the employee is entitled to be participated in the "buy-back" program according to the section of "Eligibility criteria".  The employee has to open an "IT Help" ticket with subject of "Buy-back program" included the following information:
     <em>
      model , Computer Serial Number (e.g. Dell Precision 5500, Serial Number: ABC123D)
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If more than one employee is going to buy back the same old laptop or desktop then the order of the initial waitlist is to be determined by a lottery between the employees who want to buy it back. If the employee is not going to buy back the old laptop or desktop, then the next employee on the waiting list can buy it back. This process continues until the waiting list is empty.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      Note: All "IT Help" tickets have been assigned a priority which are defined and set by the IT.  IT Help tickets related to "Buy-back program" have always the lowest priority.
     </em>
     <br/>
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   EU Administration (Finance) calculates the FVM of the laptop or desktop and add it to the corresponding "IT Help" ticket.
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The employee has to confirm on the corresponding "IT Help" ticket whether he or she is going to buy the new laptop or/and desktop back and he or she is going to pay the FMV for the laptop.
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   IT updates the corresponding "IT Help" ticket: the old laptop and desktop will be restored to their clear state.
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   <strong>
   </strong>
   IT updates the corresponding "IT help" ticket and inform the employee when the laptop or desktop is available for taking over.
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>

   <br/>
   <br/>
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>

   <br/>
   <em>
    <strong>
     By taking possession of the device under this policy, you acknowledge and agree that the device provided to you under this policy is provided "as is" with no representations or warranties. Schrödinger GmbH is not and shall not be liable to you or any other person for any bodily injury, direct, special, incidental, indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for lost business or profits, loss of goodwill, loss of data or costs of procurement of substitute goods or services arising in connection with the laptop/desktop you have taken possession of under this policy.

<h3>
 Payment process
</h3>
<p>
 The FMV will be added as a taxable gain (=geldwerter Vorteil) to the next payslip. On this amount the employee has to pay individual taxes and social contributions, which will be automatically calculated and deducted through the payroll process.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  The device is considered to be paid after the completion of the payroll process!
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Example:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">
 if the monthly gross salary is EUR 3.000,-, and you buy back a device with the FMV of EUR 500.-, your new taxable income for this month is EUR 3.500,-.
