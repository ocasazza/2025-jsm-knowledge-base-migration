 Introduction
</h1>
<p>
 In order to both standardize our AWS account configuration, apply baseline industry best practices, and improve our overall cloud governance and security footprint, some basic information is needed before we create a new AWS account.  This is not an approval process, but collecting the details needed so that the account can be created and delivered with minimal back-and-forth.

 Questions for Requestor
</h1>
<ol start="1">
 <li>
  <p>
   What's a good name for the account?
  </p>
  <ol start="1">
   <li>
    <p>
     What is it going to be used for?  This helps us understand a broader context.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     We are going to be asked "Why not GCP?"  Please give us a sentence or two to help us respond to that question.
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   What group is going to be responsible for whatever and everything that happens within this new account?
  </p>
  <ol start="1">
   <li>
    <p>
     One to three individuals who will be overall responsible for everything (Will be added to "Owners" contact for the account, which is a super-set that includes the next three, and can manage all four groups)
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     One to three individuals to be added to the "Infosec" contact, will be notified of any security or abuse issues, and can be point contacts for any needed Infosec remediation efforts. (Owners get all Security emails)
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Individuals or a team email group to be added to the "Ops" contact, who will be notified of AWS driven maintenance activities, like degraded hardware and server reboots. (Owners get all Ops emails)
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Optionally, individuals to be added to the "Billing" contact, who will get copies of monthly invoices, but no other AWS emails.  (Owners get all Billing emails)
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   What stage in the environment lifecycle will this account be used for?  (a suffix will be added to the end of the account alias)
  </p>
  <ol start="1">
   <li>
    <p>
     This is a somewhat abstract
     <em>
      descriptive
     </em>
     list, very few projects need all stages, some projects only need one or two.  The purpose is to provide some operational context for how the account will be used, and to configure names and integrations to the rest of Schrödinger appropriately.

   Are any other IAM roles needed?

  <p>
   What is the VPC design?  This directly impacts the IP address CIDR block assignment.  IP address allocation is basically impossible to re-do, and trying to speed through this step creates significant network technical debt.
  </p>
  <ol start="1">
   <li>
    <p>
     What region(s)?  Each region needs a separate VPC and therefore a unique CIDR block.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Will there be both private and public subnets?  How big are they?
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Will multiple availability zones be used?  How many?
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     What's the total CIDR size needed for each VPC?
