<h3>
 The following steps allow you to use ssh between computers that share your login directory without specifying a password.
</h3>
<ol start="1">
 <li>
  <p>
   Open a terminal window.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Generate a public/private RSA key pair on a host of your choice, whose home directory is shared with the remote hosts that you want to run jobs on:
  </p>
  <ol start="1">
   <li>
    <p>
     <sup>
      cd ~/.ssh
     </sup>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <sup>
      ssh-keygen -t rsa
     </sup>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     When asked for a passphrase do not enter one; just press
     <strong>
      ENTER
     </strong>
     . If you specify a passphrase it defeats the purpose of configuring passwordless ssh.  You do not need to do this if you already have a key pair that does not use a passphrase.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Add your public key to the list of keys allowed to log in to your account:
  </p>
  <ol start="1">
   <li>
    <p>
     <sup>
      cat id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; authorized_keys
     </sup>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <sup>
      cat id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; authorized_keys2
     </sup>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     The two separate files are necessary to support both OpenSSH 1.5 and OpenSSH 2.0 protocols. Some versions use just one or the other of these files.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Remove your known_hosts file:
  </p>
  <ol start="1">
   <li>
    <p>
     <sup>
      rm known_hosts*
     </sup>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     This is necessary so that the new RSA key-pair mechanism is used for every host. Otherwise, hosts to which you previously connected using passwords might not use the new system automatically.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Make sure your home directory cannot be written by anyone but you:
  </p>
  <ol start="1">
   <li>
    <p>
     <sup>
      chmod go-w ~
     </sup>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     This is required before SSH will allow passwordless access to your account.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Make sure your .ssh directory cannot be read or written by anyone but you:
  </p>
  <ol start="1">
   <li>
    <p>
     <sup>
      chmod go-rw ~/.ssh
     </sup>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     This is required before SSH will allow passwordless access to your account.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 For each home directory that is not shared with that of the chosen host, you need to copy the keys to the .ssh subdirectory.
</p>
<p>
 <span style="color: rgb(23,43,77);">
  Make sure your .ssh directory cannot be read
 </span>
 On Linux, you can simply run the following command:
</p>
<p>
 <sup>
  ssh-copy-id user@remote-host
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 This command copies the keys and performs the necessary setup and permissions changes.
</p>
<p>
 On Mac, or if the above command does not work on Linux, you can do the setup manually as follows:
</p>
<ol start="1">
 <li>
  <p>
   Copy the public and private keys to the target home directory:
  </p>
  <p>
   <sup>
    scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa* other-host:~/.ssh/
   </sup>
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Connect to the host on which that home directory is mounted and change to the .ssh directory:
  </p>
  <p>
   <sup>
    cd ~/.ssh
   </sup>
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Repeat Step 3 through Step 6 above.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   <sup>
    Ensure that id_rsa (the private key) is readable and writable only by the user:
   </sup>
   <br/>
   <sup>
    chmod go-rwx ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   </sup>
  </p>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 To test that passwordless SSH has been set up properly, you can execute a command on a remote host for which it is set up as follows:
</p>
<p>
 <sup>
  ssh username@remotehost date
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 You should see a single line of output reporting the date on the remote host. If you are prompted for a password, the setup has not been done correctly. You should review the steps above to ensure that you have completed them all, especially the permissions.
