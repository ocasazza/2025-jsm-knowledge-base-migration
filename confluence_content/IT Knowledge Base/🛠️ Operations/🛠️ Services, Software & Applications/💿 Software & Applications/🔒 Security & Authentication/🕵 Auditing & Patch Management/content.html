  Differences from MDM Solutions
 </strong>
 :
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Mobile Device Management (MDM)
   </strong>
   solutions focus specifically on managing mobile devices within an organization. They provide features such as device enrollment, configuration, security policies, and remote wipe capabilities. In contrast, auditing and patch management tools are broader in scope, focusing on the overall security and compliance of all IT assets, not just mobile devices.

</h3>
<p>
 FleetDM is an open-source tool for managing and monitoring fleets of devices. It provides visibility into the devices on a network, allowing administrators to track software inventory, compliance, and security posture. FleetDM is useful for organizations looking to maintain oversight of their IT assets and ensure they are secure and compliant.
</p>
<p>
 In summary, while auditing and patch management tools focus on compliance and security updates across all systems, MDM solutions specifically manage mobile devices. SentinelOne and FleetDM serve different purposes within the security and management landscape, with SentinelOne focusing on endpoint protection and FleetDM on device management and monitoring.
