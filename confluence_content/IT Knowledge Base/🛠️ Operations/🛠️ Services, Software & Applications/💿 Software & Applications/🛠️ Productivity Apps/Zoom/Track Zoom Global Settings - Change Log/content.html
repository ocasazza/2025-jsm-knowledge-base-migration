    Improve user friendliness settings on Zoom users

  Here are the new settings.
  <ul>
   <li>
    Turned off passcodes for new meetings, for instant meetings, and personal meetings.
   </li>
   <li>
    I now locked Waiting Room ON – though it's already implied if "Require all meetings are secured with one security option" is on and passcodes are off then WR is the only option of security. But just to be safe, I disabled users from toggling that off.
   </li>
   <li>
    Also turned off "Room Meeting ID Passcode" – not entirely sure if this was off or on prior to these changes. Grisha Levit if this creates issues for Zoom Rooms, then please let me know or adjust the setting here.

 <strong>
  What prompted the Change?

</h3>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>
   Following a recommendation from

   </ac:link>
   and because it makes sense.
  </p>
 </li>
</ul>
<h3>
 <strong>
  Rationale/Justification for Change
 </strong>
</h3>
<ul>
 <li>
  The setting is intended to further harden the security of our Zoom events and prevent unauthorized attendees from getting into meetings by dialing in without a passcode.
 </li>
 <li>
  The setting can be "Locked" as admin to enforce it once we conclude there are no side effects.
 </li>
</ul>
