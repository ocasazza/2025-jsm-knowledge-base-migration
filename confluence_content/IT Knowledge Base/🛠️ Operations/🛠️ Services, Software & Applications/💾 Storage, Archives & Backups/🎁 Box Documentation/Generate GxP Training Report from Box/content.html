 As a Box co-admin with the necessary permissions to generate reports, you can create a task assignment report by following these steps:
</p>
<h3>
 Step 1: Log in to Box
</h3>
<p>
 Access Box via Okta and click on the "Admin Console" button located in the bottom corner.
</p>
<h3>
 Step 2: Navigate to Reports
</h3>
<p>
 From the left-side menu, select "Reports."
</p>
<h3>
 Step 3: Create a New Report
</h3>
<p>
 Click on "Create Report," then choose the "User" tab.
</p>
<h3>
 Step 4: Configure User Activity
</h3>
<p>
 Select "User Activity" and click "Next" to configure your filters.
</p>
<h3>
 Step 5: Select Report Parameters
</h3>
<p>
 Choose the columns you want to include or leave them as default. Specify the folder where training tasks are assigned. If training tasks are scattered across multiple folders, leave this unselected to include all folders. Set the date range for the report; I recommend selecting the last 3 to 4 years to ensure all relevant data is captured.
</p>
<h3>
 Step 6: Filter Action Types
</h3>
<p>
 In the "Action types" filter section, scroll down the left-side menu and select "Tasks." Alternatively, you can type "Task" in the search box and select all three task activity types: (1) Assigned a task, (2) Updated a task assignment, and (3) Created a task.

<h3>
 Step 7: Generate the Report
</h3>
<p>
 Scroll back to the top and click "Run" to generate the report. This process may take a few minutes. Once completed, you can find the report in the "Reports" section of the admin console, complete with the date and time of creation, or you can access it from your Box home folder in the "Reports" folder.
</p>
<h3>
 Step 8: Download and Analyze the CSV
</h3>
<p>
 Download the CSV file from the report and open it in Excel. This will allow you to match the task creator/assigner with the users assigned to tasks. The CSV includes various fields, such as the user name and email (the individual who performed the action), the action type (notably "updated assignment"), and the file path (indicating where the training assignment is located). For better visibility, focus on the "Details" column, which contains information about the assignee and the task status (complete, approved, rejected, etc.) along with the corresponding dates.

 We believe this guide provides all the essential information you need. Although the report can be stored as an edited version for your purposes, you can demonstrate to auditors how the original data was acquired to ensure the integrity of the report.
