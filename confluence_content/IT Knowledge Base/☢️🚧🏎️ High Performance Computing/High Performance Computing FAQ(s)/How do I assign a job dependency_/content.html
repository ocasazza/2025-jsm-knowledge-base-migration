 If you would like one job to wait on another job's completion before it runs, you can use the -hold_jid wc_job_list option to qsub when you submit your job. You can also add this to your -QARG option in your hostfile. wc_job_list should contain a comma separated list of the jobs you will wait on for completion.

<p>
 If the job that you want to have wait is already submitted in the queue, you can run "qalter -hold_jid wc_job_list jobIDYouWantHeld"

    As a researcher, I need to know how to set up dependencies between jobs so I can ensure they execute in the correct sequence and optimize my workflow.
