 On bolt please limit yourself to not more than 10,000 jobs in the queue at any one time. The system can gracefully handle around 15K jobs before it begins to bog down (so please reduce that 10K number if there are already many jobs in the queue). If you absolutely must have more jobs than that in the queue at once, please reach out to sysmgr to discuss.

    As a researcher, I need to understand the limits on how many jobs I can submit simultaneously so I can plan my work without negatively impacting the cluster performance.
