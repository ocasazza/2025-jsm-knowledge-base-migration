<p>
 If your legacy jobcontrol database gets too large (disk usage, number of files or directories), it can cause high load on the submission nodes when jobcontrol processes try to scan the database, in addition to using up disk space.
</p>
<p>
 You can clean your jobcontrol database with the following command. However, please see the links below to understand the implications of running this command.
</p>
<p>
 $SCHRODINGER/jobcontrol -delete all
</p>
