 It's likely that there are not enough GPUs available on a single system (most jobs need at least 4). It could be there are just 1-3 GPUs available on various hosts. You can run "qalter -w v " (substituting your job's jobid for ) to see if there is a problem with your job submission, or if it's just that there is a full queue.

    As a researcher, I need to understand why my job isn't starting despite available GPUs so I can identify and resolve any configuration issues with my job submission.
