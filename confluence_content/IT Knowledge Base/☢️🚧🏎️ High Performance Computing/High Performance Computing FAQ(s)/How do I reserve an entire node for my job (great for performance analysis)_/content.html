 To reserve an entire node, please use the "-l exclusive" flag. This flag will ensure that your job is the only one dispatched to the node.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Note:
 </strong>
 Requesting an entire node will mean the job will wait until all other jobs have completed running on a node. You should also use the "-R y" flag to ensure the queuing system will reserve a spot for your job in advance.
