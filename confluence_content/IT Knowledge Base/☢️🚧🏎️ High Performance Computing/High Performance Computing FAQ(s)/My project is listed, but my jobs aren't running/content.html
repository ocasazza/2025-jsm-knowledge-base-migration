 Check the load and compare your share against the % allocation your project is assigned in the spreadsheet. If it's way off for more than 12 hours, or if the overall load is low (&lt;85%) open a support ticket (
 <a href="mailto:it-help@schrodinger.com">
  it-help@schrodinger.com
 </a>
 ) so we can investigate. See also "My job isn't running".

   <p>
    As a researcher with an approved project, I need to understand why my jobs aren't running despite having project allocation so I can resolve the issue and continue my work.
