# Confluence Page Migration Planner

This document outlines the migration plan for reorganizing Confluence pages from their current flat structure into a hierarchical organization.

## Notes

1. Content Merging Required:
   - Apple device documentation should be consolidated
   - Ubuntu workstation configurations should be merged
   - SSH configuration guides should be combined
   - Zoom-related documentation should be organized under a single parent

2. Cleanup Tasks:
   - Remove duplicate content after merging
   - Update cross-references between pages
   - Ensure consistent formatting across sections

3. Migration Order:
   1. Create the main category pages first
   2. Migrate individual pages
   3. Merge related content
   4. Update links and references
   5. Archive or delete redundant pages
